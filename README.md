# Tractivity

This software was created as a way for users to keep track of their extracurriculars / activities.

## Technologies used

Many different technologies were used to create this software, with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) being the foundation.

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Planetscale (MySQL)](https://planetscale.com/)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)


## Features

The application has the goal to be feature rich while remaining easy to use.

- Activity set (tag / folder) creation
- Activity creation
- Uploading files for activities.
- Creating detailed account of activity.
- Easy linking and linking of activities to sets.
- User sign up / sign in.

## Structuring

The demo version of this software had the task of creating a foundation from complete scratch with a focus on testing. As a result of being completely from scratch, some things from the demo will be built on or changed.

Activity set
-Amazon job application

Activities
-Research Paper
-Amazon internship
-Toured Amazon headquarters
-Course on Amazon Web Services

Activity set
-Activities for College application

Activities
-Research Paper
-Amazon internship
-Captain of the soccer team
-Volunteered for a non-profit
As you can see you can have an activity be in multiple sets, and a set can contain multiple activities (many-to-many relationship).

## What comes next?

As Tractivity grows and gains more user feedback, changes will be made to the application. The goal is to get Tractivity used by students worldwide.
